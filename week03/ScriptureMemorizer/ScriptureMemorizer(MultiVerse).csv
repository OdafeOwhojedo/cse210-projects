Exodus,20,3,17,3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth: 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it. 12  Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour�s house thou shalt not covet thy neighbour�s wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbour�s.
Abraham,3,22,23,22 Now the Lord had shown unto me Abraham the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; 23 And God saw these souls that they were good and he stood in the midst of them and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.

Isaiah,29,13,14,13  Wherefore the Lord said Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: 14 Therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
Ezekiel,3,17,21,17 Son of man I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me. 18 When I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 19 Yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 20 Again When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and I lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

Malachi,3,8,10,8  Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me even this whole nation. 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
Matthew,5,14,16,"14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 15 Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works,and glorify your Father which is in heaven."

Luke,24,36,39,36 And as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them Peace be unto you. 37 But they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38 And he said unto them Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 39 Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.

1 Corinthians,15,20,22,20 But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept. 21 For since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians,15,40,42,40 There are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another. 41 There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
Ephesians,2,19,20,19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God; 20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

2 Timothy,3,15,17,15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works.
James,1,5,6,5 If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 6 But let him ask in faith nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

2 Nephi,32,8,9,8 And now my beloved brethren I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray but teacheth him that he must not pray. 9 But behold I say unto you that ye must pray always and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.
Mosiah,18,8,10,"8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God and to be called his people and are willing to bear one another�s burdens that they may be light; 9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in even until death that ye may be redeemed of God and be numbered with those of the first resurrection that ye may have eternal life� 10 Now I say unto you if this be the desire of your hearts what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him that ye will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?"
Alma,7,11,13,11 And he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. 12 And he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. 13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold this is the testimony which is in me.
Alma,34,9,10,"9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea all are fallen and are lost and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made. 10 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man neither of beast neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice."
Moroni,10,4,5,"4 And when ye shall receive these things I would exhort you that ye would ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent having faith in Christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost. 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."
D&C,1,37,38,37 Search these commandments for they are true and faithful and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 38 What I the Lord have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away my word shall not pass away but shall all be fulfilled whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same.
D&C,8,2,3,"2 Yea behold I will tell you in your mind and in your heart by the Holy Ghost which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. 3 Now behold this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground."

D&C,18,15,16,15 And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people and bring save it be one soul unto me how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! 16 And now if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!
D&C,19,16,19,16 For behold I God have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent; 17 But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I; 18 Which suffering caused myself even God the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore and to suffer both body and spirit�and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink� 19 Nevertheless glory be to the Father and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.
D&C,49,15,17,15 And again verily I say unto you that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God for marriage is ordained of God unto man. 16 Wherefore it is lawful that he should have one wife and they twain shall be one flesh and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation; 17 And that it might be filled with the measure of man according to his creation before the world was made.
D&C,58,43,43,42 Behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and I the Lord remember them no more. 43 By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins�behold he will confess them and forsake them.
D&C,64,9,11,9 Wherefore I say unto you that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin. 10 I the Lord will forgive whom I will forgive but of you it is required to forgive all men. 11 And ye ought to say in your hearts�let God judge between me and thee and reward thee according to thy deeds.
D&C,89,18,21,18 And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings walking in obedience to the commandments shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; 19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge even hidden treasures; 20 And shall run and not be weary and shall walk and not faint. 21 And I the Lord give unto them a promise that the destroying angel shall pass by them as the children of Israel and not slay them. Amen.
D&C,130,22,23,22 The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man�s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us. 23 A man may receive the Holy Ghost and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him.
D&C,131,1,4,1 In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; 2 And in order to obtain the highest a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; 3 And if he does not he cannot obtain it. 4 He may enter into the other but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.
